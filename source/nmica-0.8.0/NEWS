NestedMICA 0.8.0 (25th April 2007)
----------------------------------

    * Major changes to the build system.  On supported platforms, it
      should now be possible to compile NestedMICA in a single step
      using the ANT tool.
    * NestedMICA now requires ANT 1.7.0 or later (http://ant.apache.org/)
    * Many programs in the NestedMICA suite have been renamed to be
      more distinctive (there were too many motifscanners in this
      world!).  All new names start with the prefix "nm".  Existing
      tools have been renamed as follows:

           motiffinder   -> nminfer
           makemosaicbg  -> nmmakebg
           motifscanner  -> nmscan
           dlepnode      -> nmworker

      Also, a few old tools have been removed.  The only one that
      most users might notice is motifviewer, which has been replaced
      by the MotifExplorer tool.  You can download MotifExplorer from
      http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/nmica/mxt.shtml
    * Several command line switches have been renamed.  If in doubt,
      check the manual or run the command with the -help switch.
    * When running on Java versions prior to 6.0, NestedMICA now requires
      two new libraries: stax-api.jar and wstx.jar.  Suitable versions
      are included with the download.
    * The background model format has changed to a new XML-based format.
      Old background models can be updated using the nmconvertbg tool.
    * The concept of "order" when applied to background models has
      changed: mononucleotide models are now considered to be order 0
      (in common with most literature in the field) rather than order 1.
    * If you run nminfer without the -backgroundModel option, it will
      automatically build a background model using the supplied sequences.
    * nminfer can now automatically infer motif lengths.  To take advantage
      of this feature, you need to specify a length range using the
      -minLength and -maxLength options.
    * When running in distributed mode, it is now possible to do some
      processing on the master node as well by specifying "-threads N"
      where N is greater than zero.  Please consult the manual for more
      details.
    * Improved support for "counted" motif models, including performance
      improvements and one serious bug-fix.  Note that the default
      (uncounted) model is still recommended for most purposes.
    * Many smaller performance improvements.
    
    * KNOWN ISSUE: nminfer startup time can be very slow if it is run with
      many short sequences and a large value of the -numMotifs parameter.
      This should be fixed in the next release.  For now, we would suggest
      removing all sequences less than about 50 bases when running nminfer
      with a large -numMotifs value.

NestedMICA 0.7.3 (3rd November 2006)
------------------------------------

    * Support for Intel macs
    * Preliminary support for finding motifs in protein sequences
      (thanks to Mutlu Dogruel)
    * Much faster motifscanner
    * Better default options when searching for large numbers of motifs
    * The -workerThreads option has been renamed -threads

NestedMICA 0.7.2 (12th January 2006)
------------------------------------

    * Thread-safety bugfixes
    * Added links to MotifExplorer

NestedMICA 0.7.1 (1st December 2005)
------------------------------------

    * Many small bug-fixes, including checkpoint-restarting and
      command-line option processing
    * Added a Solaris port (thanks to Mikhail Velikanov).

NestedMICA 0.7.0 (10th June 2005)
---------------------------------

    * Now requires a Java 5 platform
    * New required library: bjv2-core. A suitable snapshot is included
      in the lib/ directory
    * Improved command-line handling, and cleaned up the command lines
      for main tools. All tools now print a list of options in
      response to the '-help' switch.
    * Significant (typically a factor of 2) performance improvements
      when finding multiple motifs.
    * Better criteria for automatic termination. This is still
      intentionally somewhat conservative, but is much more usable
      than previous versions.
    * Uses more efficient synchronization code when running on
      multiple processors .

NestedMICA 0.06
---------------

    * Now searches JAVA_HOME for a Java runtime
    * Added the printmosaicbg program to inspect background model files

NestedMICA 0.05
---------------

    * Wrapper scripts and build process have been updated.
    * Required libraries (biojava, bytecode, changeless) are now
      included in the default distribution
    * Memory usage for large datasets has been substantially reduced
    * Further improvements to the -distributed mode. This now includes
      a simple load-balancing system which allows operation on
      hetrogenous clusters.

NestedMICA 0.04
---------------

    * Default motif output format is now XML-based (.xms)
    * Minor performance improvements
    * Distributed mode is now more robust, and uses various strategies
      to reduce network traffic and avoid packet-loss problems.

NestedMICA 0.03
---------------

    * More bug-fixes
    * Better defaults
    * Added some code for testing different background models

NestedMICA 0.02
---------------

    * Fixed a bug restarting checkpoints
    * Minor performance improvements
    * Added wrapper scripts for launching the main programs
    * Added termination conditions
    * More command line cleanups

NestedMICA 0.01
---------------

    * First public release
